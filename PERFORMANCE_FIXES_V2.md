# Performance Optimizations - CORRECTED VERSION

## What Went Wrong Initially

My first optimization attempt actually **made things worse** by adding aggressive code splitting that created too much overhead:
- Bundle increased from 176 kB → 486 kB (3x larger!)
- LCP got worse: 7.7s → 9.1s
- Performance score dropped: 59 → 55

## ✅ Proper Fixes Applied

### 1. **Removed Bad Code Splitting**
**Problem:** Aggressive webpack splitChunks configuration created unnecessary overhead

**Fix:** Simplified webpack config to use Next.js defaults
- Removed custom vendor/common/library chunks
- Let Next.js handle code splitting automatically
- Only kept essential optimizations

**Result:** Bundle reduced from 486 kB → 102 kB (79% reduction!)

---

### 2. **Lazy Loaded Heavy Components**
**Problem:** Map library (45 KiB) loading on initial page load

**Fix:** Dynamic imports for below-the-fold components
```tsx
// Before:
import EnhancedMapSection from "@/components/home/EnhancedMapSection"

// After:
const EnhancedMapSection = dynamic(
  () => import("@/components/home/EnhancedMapSection"),
  { ssr: false }
)
```

**Components Lazy Loaded:**
- ✅ EnhancedMapSection (with leaflet maps)
- ✅ TestimonialsCarousel
- ✅ TrustBadges
- ✅ FeaturedBlogCard

**Result:** Initial bundle reduced by ~120 kB

---

### 3. **Added Map Tile Preconnect**
**Problem:** Map tiles from cartocdn.com causing 300ms delay each

**Fix:** Added preconnect hints in layout.tsx
```tsx
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://a.basemaps.cartocdn.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://b.basemaps.cartocdn.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://c.basemaps.cartocdn.com" />
```

**Result:** Saves ~900ms when maps load (3 × 300ms)

---

### 4. **Modern JavaScript Build**
**Problem:** 12 KiB of unnecessary polyfills for old browsers

**Fix:** Updated browserslist to target modern browsers only
```json
"browserslist": [
  "chrome >= 91",
  "firefox >= 90",
  "safari >= 14",
  "edge >= 91"
]
```

**Removed Polyfills:**
- Array.prototype.at
- Array.prototype.flat/flatMap
- Object.fromEntries
- Object.hasOwn
- String.prototype.trimStart/trimEnd
- @babel/plugin-transform-classes
- @babel/plugin-transform-spread

**Result:** ~12 KiB savings + faster execution

### 5. **Video Optimization (From Previous)**
**Still Applied:**
- ✅ Video disabled on mobile devices
- ✅ Delayed video loading by 1 second
- ✅ Added preload="none"
- ✅ Video captions support

---

### 6. **Accessibility Fixes (From Previous)**
**Still Applied:**
- ✅ 44x44px minimum touch targets
- ✅ Proper aria-labels on all icon links
- ✅ Increased button spacing

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Bundle Size Reduction
**Before:** 358 kB total (176 kB shared + 182 kB page)
**After:** 225 kB total (102 kB shared + 123 kB page)
**Savings:** **133 kB (-37%)**

### JavaScript Optimization
- Maps library no longer in initial bundle (loads on demand)
- Testimonials lazy loaded (only loads when scrolling)
- Trust badges lazy loaded
- Blog cards lazy loaded
- Modern ES6+ code (no legacy polyfills)

### Network Optimization
- Preconnect to map tile servers (-900ms when maps load)
- Preload critical logo image
- Video loads after page interactive
- Google Analytics deferred

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
npm run start
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Run Lighthouse test
```

### 3. Verify Improvements
Check that:
- [ ] Homepage bundle is ~225 kB (down from 358 kB)
- [ ] Map doesn't load immediately (check Network tab)
- [ ] No map tiles loading on initial page load
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance > 80 (mobile)
- [ ] No legacy JavaScript polyfills in bundle

### 4. Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "perf: reduce bundle size by 37% with proper lazy loading"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Monitor Production
- Run Lighthouse on https://switchinvest.be
- Check Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Monitor real user metrics

## 📈 What Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **next.config.mjs** - Simplified webpack config, removed bad code splitting
2. **app/page.tsx** - Added dynamic imports for heavy components
3. **app/layout.tsx** - Added map tile preconnect hints
4. **package.json** - Updated browserslist to modern browsers
5. **components/home/AnimatedHero.tsx** - Video optimization (from v1)
6. **components/footer.tsx** - Accessibility fixes (from v1)

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### ❌ What NOT to Do:
1. **Don't over-optimize code splitting** - Next.js already does this well
2. **Don't create too many chunks** - More chunks = more overhead
3. **Don't split everything** - Only split truly heavy/optional code
4. **Don't ignore bundle analysis** - Always check bundle size after changes

### ✅ What WORKS:
1. **Lazy load below-the-fold content** - Maps, testimonials, etc.
2. **Use dynamic imports** - For components not needed immediately
3. **Preconnect to external domains** - Saves 300ms per domain
4. **Target modern browsers** - Removes unnecessary polyfills
5. **Keep webpack config simple** - Trust Next.js defaults

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If bundle size is still large:
```bash
# Analyze the bundle
npm run build
# Check the bundle size in the output
```

### If map doesn't load:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify dynamic import syntax
- Test with actual user scroll

### If Performance score is still low:
- Clear browser cache
- Test in incognito mode
- Run on actual mobile device
- Check for third-party scripts
